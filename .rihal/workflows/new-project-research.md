# Subworkflow: new-project — Research Phase

<purpose>
Research phase of /rihal:new-project. Loaded from new-project.md via @-reference when user opts into research. Produces research artifacts that feed into Step 7 (Define Requirements) and Step 8 (Create Roadmap).

**Invariants from parent:** {project_name}, {planning_artifacts}, {researcher_model}, {synthesizer_model}, {user_preference_research}. Set in new-project.md Steps 1–5.5 before this loads.
</purpose>

## 6. Research Decision

**If auto mode:** Default to "Research first" without asking.

Use AskUserQuestion:

- header: "Research"
- question: "Research the domain ecosystem before defining requirements?"
- options:
  - "Research first (Recommended)" — Discover standard stacks, expected features, architecture patterns
  - "Skip research" — I know this domain well, go straight to requirements

**If "Research first":**

Display stage banner:

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
 Rihal ► RESEARCHING
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Researching [domain] ecosystem...
```

Create research directory:

```bash
mkdir -p .planning/research
```

**Determine milestone context:**

Check if this is greenfield or subsequent milestone:

- If no "Validated" requirements in PROJECT.md → Greenfield (building from scratch)
- If "Validated" requirements exist → Subsequent milestone (adding to existing app)

Display spawning indicator:

```
◆ Spawning 4 researchers in parallel...
  → Stack research
  → Features research
  → Architecture research
  → Pitfalls research
```

Spawn 4 parallel rihal-project-researcher agents with path references:

```

<milestone_context>

Greenfield: Research the standard stack for building [domain] from scratch.
